5# QUESTÄ°ON - ANSWERS REST API

I developed a Question-Answer REST API using JavaScript, following the Model-Controller-View (MCV) methodology. This API allows users to interact with a database or dataset by sending HTTP requests to the server. The model handles the data logic, the controller manages the flow of data between the model and the view, and the view displays the data to the user.

The project is structured to separate concerns, making it modular and easier to maintain. This API can be integrated into various applications or used as a standalone service for handling question-answer interactions programmatically.
